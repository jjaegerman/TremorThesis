# Parkinson’s Tremor Segmentation and Severity Classification
This repository contains the code used to conduct the main experimentation in the [Parkinson’s Tremor Segmentation and Severity Classification thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KKIRPXyYpAbAwkRbH5QbIRa5jyWofCkz/view?usp=drive_link) authored by Jonathan Jaegerman during his bachelor's at the University of Toronto.
This work was supervised by Prof. Deepa Kundur, mentored by Christopher Lucasius and produced in collaboration with the [Kundur Research Group](https://dkundur.comm.utoronto.ca/).
